 <h2 id="Start">The start of the war </h2>  
   <p>Over the years, historians have argued about when the war started.Although the war officaly started in 1939, some say that World war II started as early as 1933 when Hitler took power, or as late as 1941, when the USA entered the war against Japan. Here is a list of dates that historians say that the war started on: 
       
<ul>
        <li>1933, When Adolf Hitler took power in Germany and became a dictator</li>
        <li>1937, When The Imperial Japanese army invaded Manchuria.</li>
        <li>1939 The war offically started in this year, when Hitler invaded poland. </li>
        <li>1940, When the Soviet Union joined the war*.</li>
        <li>1941, When the USA joined the war
    </ul>

<p>The the war in Europe started When Germany invaded Poland on September 1st, 1939. After the invasion, Great britain and France, allies of Poland Declared war on Germany. Germany invaded Poland because of three reasons:

<p>Adolf Hitler was a german politician who was the leader of the Nazi party. Hitler served in World war I and he hated the treaty of  versailles (the treaty that ended world war I). It made Germany take all the blame for the war, made germany drastically reduce the size if its armed forces, and banned germany from having an air force. Hitler forced President Hindiberg to make him chancellor.After Hindiberg died, Hitler named himself FÃ¼hrer
(Leader) and became a dictator.  </p>

<p>After Hitler took over Poland, he tuned his eyes on France.

<h2 id="France">The Fall of France</h2>

<p>When The Nazis succeded in occupiying poland, They wanted even more land. So, they decided to take over France.The British and the French had declared war on germany folowing the invasion of Poland, so after poland fell,they were fighting along the belgien/french border. During world war I, germany had failed to conquer france, but this time, Hitler had a trick up sleave.Blitzkrieg (lightning war ).British and 
 french troops had arrived at the french border to meet the german troops.The germans circled the Allied troops at lightning speed and trapped them at dunkirk, a beach by the english channel. The Allies were trapped, unable to escape so civilian  ships nearby went to bring their troops home.</p><strong> But wait, there`s more.</strong><p> When the Allies went to fight by the coast, they left the french/german border, the ardenne forest, unguarded. They thought it was imposible to go through. And the germans were going through it with everything they had. They were able to take Paris, and france fell. What germany wasn`t able to do in world war I, the Nazis had done in one simple srategy. Also Italy joined gremany and formed the Axis.</p>   

<h2 id="Britain">The Bombing of Britain</h2>
<p>After the fall of France Hitler wanted to attack Great Britain. But, instead of just invaded the island, the Nazis chose to attack it with bombing raids. In the autum of 1940 the Luftwaffe (german air force) started to bomb British ports and shipping harbours. Hitler proposed an ultimatum, but britain refused. The Luftwaffe was unable to defeat the RAF Fighter Command (part of the royal air force), so the germans used the strategic bombing tactic. The Nazis started to bomb London and other cities during the Blitz, but the germans were not able to destroy british morale. The bombing ended in the spring of 1941.</p>

<h2 id='Africa1940' >Africa and the Mediterranean</h2>
<p>The fighting wasnt only in europe, there was fighting in Africa and the Mediterranean too. After the fall of france, all of the french colonies in africa belonged to germany. So now germany had lots of colonies in africa. Look at this map:</p>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/ColonialAfrica.png"width="308" height='343'>
<p>so now all of the French stuff belonged to germany.</p><strong>But Wait.There`s more.</strong>
<p>A french genaral named Charles de Gaulle, refusing his country`s surrender set up a goverment in-exile in england called Free France which liberated most of the french colonies in africa from german control.The germans created a division called the Afrika Korps to fight the Britsh and Free french in africa. Also, bulgaria joined the Axis, Italy took over british somliland and failed to take greece.</p>   

<h2 id="attack on soviet union">Attack on the Soviet Union (1941)</h2>
<p>After Hitler had taken over Poland, Belgium, 
Luxembourg, Denmark, The Netherlands, and France, he was sure the only reason that Britain was not surrendering was that it hoped for aid from the Soviet Union. So, the Nazis were going to try and knock out the Soviet Union in two ways:</p><ol><li>Make them join the Axis</li><li>Take over the Soviet Union</ol><p>The Nazis tried option 1 first.</p><p>Negotiations took place between germany and soviet union. The Soviet union accepted but in return, the soviets wanted concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan to which Germany refused (beacause Bulgaria and Japan were part of the Axis). On 18 December 1940, Hitler ordered to plan for an invasion of the soviet union.On 22 June 1941, during Operation Barbarossa, The Nazis invaded the Soviet Union. The objectives of the invasion were to eliminate the Soviet Union as a military power, exterminate Communism, generate Lebensraum by dispossessing the native population and guarantee access to the strategic resources needed to defeat Germany's remaining rivals. Many key battles  happened during the german advance into soviet territorry, such as Leningrad, Stalingrad, and many others.</p>
